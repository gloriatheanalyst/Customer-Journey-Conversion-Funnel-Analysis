# Customer-Journey-Conversion-Funnel-Analysis
 A Data Analytics Project Using Python & Power BI

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes an e-commerce customer journey dataset to understand user behavior, identify drop-off points, and uncover factors affecting conversion rates. A full funnel analysis was conducted, alongside exploratory data analysis (EDA), demographic behavior analysis, and time-on-page insights.

The project includes:

- Python notebook with cleaning + EDA + funnel modeling

- Power BI dashboard visualizing user flow and conversion drivers

- Recommendations to improve conversion and reduce cart abandonment

## 2. Problem Statement

E-commerce websites experience significant drop-offs throughout the customer journey. The goal of this project is to:

- Understand how users move through the product funnel (Home → Product Page → Cart → Checkout → Confirmation → Purchase).
- Identify where and why the largest drop-offs occur.
- Analyze which user attributes (Device Type, Country, Referral Source) influence purchase likelihood.
- Quantify conversion rates at each stage.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve the conversion funnel.

## 3. Project Objectives

1. Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand user behavior.
3. Build a full conversion funnel and measure drop-offs.
4. Analyze conversion rates by device, referral, and country.
5. Identify user behavior patterns such as time spent and cart usage.
6. Develop meaningful insights and recommendations.
7. Build a Power BI dashboard for visualization.

## 4. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of user browsing sessions on an e-commerce platform.

**Key columns include:**

SessionID — Unique session identifier
UserID — Unique user identifier
Timestamp — Event time
PageType — Page visited (home, product_page, cart, checkout, confirmation)
DeviceType — Mobile, Desktop, Tablet
Country — User's country
ReferralSource — Traffic origin (Google, Social, Email, etc.)
TimeOnPage_seconds — Time spent on each page
ItemsInCart — Number of items added
Purchased — 1 if purchase occurred, else 0
